# Create input files for qe/xspectra and ocean based on a material ID from the Materials Project

## Quickstart
1. Put your materials project API key in the file mp.key ( https://materialsproject.org/dashboard )
2. Overwrite the defaults ase/io/espresso.py file with the one in Xspectra
  - Either: copy it into the installed location of ase (site-packages/ase/io/epresso.py )
  - Or: copy all of ase locally, and write over ./ase/io/espresso.py
3. Run "python fetchSingle.py 390 single" (will generate input files for single run on anatase)
4. Various converge run are provided 
  - python fetchSingle.py 390 converge_k r_gs r_es sc_key (will generate input files for k-mesh convergence run on anatase with the gs radius (r_gs -> float), es radius (es -> float). If sc_key -> string starts with either f or F, it will generate the files for unit cell case)
  - python fetchSingle.py 390 converge_e 4-4-4 3-3-3 r_es (will generate input files for k-mesh convergence run on anatase with 4-4-4 as the gs kmesh and 3-3-3 as the es kmesh)

## Limitations/To-do list: (not exhaustive)
1. Fix up symmetry dipole/quad options
2. Separate xspectra to its own python file
3. JSON files with convergence options for xspectra/ocean (remove from script)
4. Unify core-hole broadening (ocean uses the FEFF look-up table)
