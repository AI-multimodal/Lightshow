# Summary

Spectroscopy simulations are a critical tool for the interpretation of experiment, the development of new theoretical understanding, and fast screening of new molecules and materials. Systematically setting up input files for different simulation codes and multiple materials can be a time-consuming task with a relatively high barrier-to-entry, given the complexities and nuances of each individual simulation package. `Lightshow` solves this problem by providing a uniform abstraction for writing computational x-ray spectroscopy input files for multiple popular codes, including FEFF, VASP, OCEAN, EXCITING and XSpectra. Its extendable framework will also allow for the community to easily make future additions, and add new simulation code.

# Statement of need

First-principles computer simulations of material and molecular properties are now a powerful tool at the forefront of bleeding-edge scientific research. On one hand, fundamental quantum mechanical equations can be solved numerically on high-performance computing systems, and the results interpreted at the microscopic level, something that is not possible otherwise. Thanks to their predictive nature, first-principles simulations provide fundamental understanding into the physical origins of various phenomena. On the other hand, they are critical to accelerating new materials design. Unlike expensive and time-consuming experiments, _in silico_ materials design frameworks can quickly screen the most promising candidates for target applications by running high-throughput calculations, allowing for a systematic down-sampling of the intractably large chemical space. The emergence of high-performance computing hardware architecture combined with the development of efficient structure search algorithms continue to fuel the advance of first-principles simulations in domain science research.

Spectroscopy is an important experimental characterization technique that probes a sample based on the light-matter interaction. Different types of spectroscopy can be classified by the energy range they probe, such as X-ray, optical and infrared spectroscopy. `Lightshow` currently focuses on writing the input files for one type: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in which a deeply bound core level electron is excited to empty states, usually in the conduction bands. XAS is particularly useful because it is element-specific and very sensitive to the local chemical environment of the absorbing sites, such as coordination number, charge state, and local symmetry. It has been widely used in condensed matter physics, geophysics, chemistry, materials science and biology for materials characterization. Recent instrument development at synchrotron light sources further improves the spatial, temporal and energy resolution of XAS, which opens new avenues in XAS research.

Despite the growing demand in first-principles XAS spectroscopy, carrying out practical calculations correctly is far from trivial, and requires a great deal of expertise in electronic structure theory, creating a formidable barrier for non-expert researchers. Most of the practical challenges boil down to the right choice of input parameters, which depends on the level of theory, details of the implementation of the simulation software and the atomic structure of the system. A general purpose software package for generating XAS simulation input files for multiple codes does not exist. `Lightshow` has been developed to fill this gap. It provides not only sets of default input parameters based on a careful multi-code XAS benchmark project [@xanesbench], but also exposes the entire suite of possible parameter choices for expert users to tune. Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use tool to the XAS community (for both newcomers and experts) for XAS simulation and analysis.

# Brief software description

![Graphical representation of the organization of the `Lightshow` repository.\label{fig:WorkflowDiagram}](figures/Lightshow_Workflow_Diagram.pdf)

We summarize the structure of `Lightshow` application programming interface (API) in Fig. \autoref{fig:WorkflowDiagram}. `Lightshow`'s core design philosophy is built around two principal objects, the `Database` class, and objects that inherit the `_BaseParameters` class. At a high-level, the `Database` class interfaces primarily with Pymatgen and the Materials Project [@Jain2013], allowing the user to easily utilize Pymatgen and pull large numbers of materials structures quickly. Functionality is also available for instantiating a `Database` via loading e.g. `POSCAR`-style structure files from disk. Once a database has been created, code-specific simulation parameters inheriting the `_BaseParameters` base class interface with various methods in Pymatgen as well as in-house built software for systematically writing input files for multiple XAS simulation programs, including FEFF [@rehr2010parameter], XSpectra [@taillefumier2002x; @gougoussis2009first; @bunuau2013projector], OCEAN [@vinson2011bethe; @ocean-3], Exciting [@exciting] and VASP [@vasp-xas]. We highlight the `_tests` directory, in which we maintain a suite of unit tests for individual functions and methods, as well as integration tests for the entire workflow. `Lightshow` is fully documented, and contains a simple example notebook for users to get started.
