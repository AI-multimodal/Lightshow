# Create input files for qe/xspectra and ocean based on a material ID from the Materials Project

## Quickstart
1. Put your materials project API key in the file mp.key ( https://materialsproject.org/dashboard )
2. Run "python fetchSingle.py 390" (will run anatase)


## Limitations/To-do list: (not exhaustive)
1. Fix up symmetry dipole/quad options
2. Separate xspectra to its own python file
3. JSON files with convergence options for xspectra/ocean (remove from script)
4. Unify core-hole broadening (ocean uses the FEFF look-up table)
