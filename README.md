------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lightshow** is a Python library for easily generating computational
spectroscopy input files. If you use our code, please consider citing our [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.05182)
in the Journal of Open Source Software.

Often, it can be daunting to create comprehensive, well documented
databases of materials structures and their x-ray absorption spectra.
**Lightshow** solves this problem, allowing new users to choose sensible
defaults for their calculations, while simultaneously exposing all
functionality for experts.

**Lightshow** aims to provide a \"one-stop-shop\" for input file
generation, and currently supports the following codes:

-   [FEFF](https://feff.phys.washington.edu)
-   [VASP](https://www.vasp.at)
-   [OCEAN](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/ocean)
-   [EXCITING](https://exciting-code.org)
-   [Xspectra](https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/tree/master/XSpectra)

with more on the way! The software is intended to be user-friendly,
extensively documented and tested, and extendable for those users who
wish to add additional spectroscopy functionalities. There are also a
few comprehensive tutorials to help you get started.

## Tutorials

We offer a few tutorials to get you started (with more on the way!)

| # | Tutorial | Description | Notebook |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Basic usage | Pull structure data from Materials Project, write input files for all codes | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AI-multimodal/Lightshow/blob/master/notebooks/00_basic_usage.ipynb) |
| 2 | Spectral broadening | Utilities for broadening spectra |[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AI-multimodal/Lightshow/blob/master/notebooks/01_Ti_K_anatase_broaden.ipynb) |


## Installation

To install Lightshow, simply use `pip`

``` bash
pip install lightshow
```

Make sure you've set your Materials Project v2 API key as well! You can find some documentation on how to query data [here](https://docs.materialsproject.org/downloading-data/using-the-api/querying-data) and how to set up your new API key [here](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/api).

```bash
export MP_API_KEY="your_Materials_Project_v2_API_key"
```

(or preferably, add `MP_API_KEY` to your bash profile).

More details can be found at our [documentation](https://ai-multimodal.github.io/Lightshow/installation.html).

### Development installation

For developers: after cloning Lightshow locally, install `pre-commit` via

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

and check that the tests (below) work correctly.

### Running tests

For developers: tests can be run via `pytest`. After cloning, simply use

```bash
pytest lightshow/_tests
```

or with coverage

```bash
pytest -v --cov --cov-report xml lightshow/_tests
```


## Contributing 

We welcome any and all contributions by the community, including pull requests, bug reports, etc.
Please see our [contributing](https://github.com/AI-multimodal/Lightshow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for more details!

### Adding new spectroscopy codes

Adding new spectroscopy codes requires one to inherit the `_BaseParameters` class from `lightshow.parameters._base`.
The new `Parameters(_BaseParameters)` object should have a `write()` method, which must take a target directory as an
argument, as well as any other keyword arguments require to write the input file (most notably, the Pymatgen structure,
either a unit or super cell). The `name` property must also be defined (corresponding to the name of the calculation,
e.g. "VASP"). Take a look at the examples in the `lightshow.parameters` module for more details!
