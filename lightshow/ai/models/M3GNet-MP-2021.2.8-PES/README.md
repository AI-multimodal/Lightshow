# Description

`M3GNet` model that is kept locally for use in `XASModels` due to [issue](https://github.com/matthewcarbone/Crescendo/issues/80) in matgl that is not loading correct model version. Models are kept here under the terms of the 3-clause BSD license and all models are attributed to the Materials Virtual Lab.

## Relevant Information

[Source](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/matgl/blob/main/pretrained_models/M3GNet-MP-2021.2.8-PES/README.md)

This model is a M3GNet universal potential for 89 elements of the periodic table. It has broad applications in the dynamic simulations of materials.

### Training dataset
